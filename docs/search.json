    "text": "Design process\nThis project was an opportunity to stretch my design skills and practice layout, typography, and colour design concepts. It was also my first time working with branding guidelines outside of academic journal figure requirements.\n\nTools\nR, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe InDesign.\n\n\nStorytelling\nThe DWF asked for visualisations that allowed them to explore and communicate their impact, as measured by reconciliACTIONs: meaningful actions that progress reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous peoples in Canada. I decided to make a report in a style similar to their yearly reports that would summarise their progress and be easy to share with stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe report first lays out definitions for steps and stages (part of the DWF’s model for measuring the impact of reconciliACTIONs), while visualising progress within each of these categories. These first visualisations and descriptions give the reader a big picture overview of the DWF’s progress as well as a foundation for understanding the DWF’s model of reconciliACTIONs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe next pages then explore reconciliACTIONs using the combined categorisation into both steps and stages, with each stage broken down into the five possible reconciliACTION steps. One visualisation shows how the number of reconciliACTIONs in each combined category changed over time, while the other shows the contributions of different types of reconciliACTIONs, coloured by their categories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I end with a call-to-action to Do Something to progress reconciliation by providing a template for tracking reconciliACTIONs. The latter was inspired by the DWF’s comment that they do not have reconciliACTION data at the level of individuals – i.e., they do not know which actions any one person has taken. I therefore wanted to invite people to track their own progress. I decided to distinguish between steps, but not stages, on the tracking template since it may be more difficult for non-experts to categorise their reconciliACTIONs by stages. Additionally, most people’s reconciliACTIONs will be in only one or two of the stages, at least in the near future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe final page of the report provides short descriptions the DWF and VFSG, as well as ways for people to find out more information about these two organisations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nColours and symbols\nI worked with the DWF’s brand colours, but I also expanded the colour palette using three main hues from the striking colour palette of one of their main resources, The Secret Path film. I used the cooler hues to represent earlier stages of reconciliACTIONs, allowing the warming of the colour palette to symbolise the progression of reconciliation. Meanwhile, each step within each stage is encoded by the lightness of the hue. The colour therefore darkens as the steps become more difficult, which corresponds nicely to the increased impact of the latter steps. The combined hue and lightness encoding allowed me to visualise the combined categorisation of each reconciliACTION in the report’s latter visualisations.\nI also incorporated imagery and art that is central to the DWF’s messaging and identity, including Secret Path lyrics, train tracks, and watercolour artwork.\n\n\nData decisions\nI decided to use the simpler DWF model of “stages” of reconciliACTIONs, rather than the categorisation into “future states” of Canada, which would have doubled the number of categories. Based on my initial data explorations, I felt that the simpler stages representation captured most of the variability in the types of reconciliACTIONs thus far, and I therefore sacrificed some level of detail to make the visualisations more accessible. Further, since the report is geared towards DWF supporters and stakeholders, I thought the stages description was most appropriate since it focuses on the development of individual participants in their path to reconciliation. However, I did tie the stages back to the future states description to explain how stages fit in to the DWF’s more detailed model.\nSome of the reconciliACTIONs had negative numbers due to a decrease in the net number of newsletter subscribers. As suggested by the DWF, I decided to transform these negative numbers to zero to prevent them from detracting from other reconciliACTIONs in the same category. My reasoning was that unsubscribing did not undo or negate the participant’s previous action of subscribing. Additionally, the unsubscribing participants may decide to continue their reconciliation journey using other approaches, such as following the DWF on social media. If possible, the DWF could separately track the number of new subscriptions and unsubscriptions in future quarters to have different options for tracking these reconciliACTIONs.\nI also combined newsletter subscribers and mailable newsletter subscribers into one category for the “Many Ways to #DoSomething” visualisation of different reconciliACTION types.\n\n\nBrainstorming\nI’ve always gravitated towards sketching out visualisation ideas, but – inspired by reading about graphic and visualisation designers’ processes – I decided to more systematically incorporate sketches into developing these visualisations. Throughout the project, I used sketches to test out different ideas for vis types, layouts, and encodings. I sketched out initial ideas after first listening to the DWF’s Viz for Social Good presentation, but I also made sure to look at the data early on to understand its limitations and the feasibility of my approach. For example, I saw early on that the different scales in the data would make it tricky to compare reconciliACTIONs across different categories. I returned to sketching throughout the project to refine my early ideas, overcome roadblocks, and test out new ideas.\nSketch photos TBA"

    "text": "Gardening’s growth during the COVID pandemic\nWith the weather warming up in Newcastle upon Tyne, I’ve been spending more time in our new garden. As a novice gardener, I’ve also been doing more research online, Googling how and when to plant my various vegetable and flower seeds. These searches made me wonder how other gardeners use Google. Do their searches also vary over the course of the year?\nUsing Google Trends data, I began investigating garden searches in the UK, focusing on “how to garden” to capture interest in hobby gardening. I soon found that the expected seasonal changes weren’t the most interesting pattern in recent years:\n\n\n\n\n\nClick on the chart for an interactive version\nCompared to the previous five years, 2020 saw more than double the number of “how to garden” searches after the first UK COVID-19 lockdown. In hindsight, the increased searches during 2020 are unsurprising, as the COVID-19 pandemic saw a dramatic increase in hobbiest gardeners. Like the pandemic, this higher interest persisted into 2021, with 2022 also seeing somewhat elevated searches. Interestingly, 2021 also bucks the usual seasonal pattern: “how to garden” searches increased a month earlier than expected, suggesting that gardeners were eager to get back outdoors after a winter of lockdowns!\nI can think of two main possibilities for the increased gardening interest:\n\nPeople looking for new at-home hobbies for themselves or their families. Many people had more free time due to furlough or working from home, and many usual hobbies and social activities were restricted by lockdowns.\nPeople who wanted access to fresh food without risking exposure to COVID-19 in shops or dealing with strange grocery delivery substitutions.\n\nTo better understand what drove the pandemic gardening Google searches, I investigated two more specific search terms: “how to grow vegetables” and “how to grow flowers.”\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth of these searches also dramatically increased during the first year of lockdowns. Although some flowers are edible or good companion plants, we can probably assume that flower searches were mostly hobby-motivated. Growing vegetables can also primarily be a hobby, but, interestingly, vegetable searches increased both sooner and more than flower searches in 2020. While home-grown crops take time to bear fruit (or veg), some searches may have been driven by initial lockdown fears or food order frustrations - especially if people suspected the pandemic would last beyond the first three week lockdown."

    "text": "Overview\nWhen seizures are not controlled by medication, one of the few remaining treatment options is brain surgery to remove the part of the brain that causes seizures. However, identifying those regions can be difficult, and people with epilepsy often continue having seizures after surgery. The main focus of my postdoc research is developing computational measures that help pinpoint pathological brain regions so that they can successfully be removed.\nThis study investigated the stability of one of our measures of brain “abnormalities” that we use to identify pathological brain regions. Our measure is computed from intracranial EEG, which is recorded from electrodes that are temporarily implanted directly on or into the brain. These recordings are usually multiple days and capture a variety of brain activity, including periods of sleep, wake, and seizures. To use our abnormality measure clinically, we first need to know whether it is robust. How much is it influenced by the type of brain activity data? How much data is needed to reliably compute it?\nWe found that although there is some variability in abnormalities at the level of different brain regions, the relationship between purportedly healthy and pathological brain regions (captured by the metric DRS) remains relatively consistent over time. Additionally, we can use DRS to distinguish subjects that were seizure free versus not seizure free after surgery. The full findings are available in our open access paper, Temporal stability of intracranial electroencephalographic abnormality maps for localizing epileptogenic tissue.\nWe used a variety of plots to visualise the data at the level of individual subjects as well as the entire cohort - I’ve included a couple examples here. This figure shows that brain abnormalities and the summary DRS metric are similar in time periods close to seizures (“peri-ictal”) and far away from seizures (“interictal”). Subjects are divided by whether they had good (ILAE 1, blue) or poor (ILAE 2-5, red) treatment outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis figure summarises results across subjects. We show the distribution of our summary measure in each subject and then use a machine learning classification metric to evaluate whether our measure distinguishes subjects by their surgical outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll figures follow the journal’s font and colour guidelines."

    "section": "Story",
    "text": "Story\nI chose to present the key message that I took away from the WHO’s VFSG presentation: anyone can have a disability. In particular, disability is (1) common, and (2) impacts people with many different demographics. In other words, people with disabilities are a large and diverse group. I decided to keep the data analysis and statistics fairly simple to focus on this main message.\nAs such, I used the demographic information to answer the question, “What are the characteristics of people with disabilities?” (for example, what percentage of people with disabilities are female?) Importantly, my approach does not reveal the prevalence within each demographic, which could potentially lead to misinterpretations. For example, someone might assume that disability is less prevalent in high-income countries, even though high-income countries actually have the highest prevalence (see pages 23-24 of the WHO disability report). However, my visualisation can also correct erroneous assumptions. For example, although people who are 60+ years old are more likely to have a disability, the global population structure means that most people with disabilities are actually under 60 years old. Thus, these statistics can challenge stereotypes about people with disabilities.\nI also wanted to present this data in a memorable and impactful way. One of my first experiences seeing data visualisation used as a story-telling tool was the New York Time’s article on how race impacts economic mobility. Rather than just presenting bar charts or a Sankey diagram, the article uses animated points to represent the economic outcomes of individual people. Years later, I still remember that message because the data was connected to individuals. Inspired by that approach, I decided to try capturing the global scale and impact of disabilities by representing every one million people with one small point. Without animations, I don’t expect my visualisation to have the same impact as the New York Times charts, but my hope is that this visualisation will encourage people to sit with the data and mentally grasp the number of people living with disabilities. However, representing the data this way could also lead to accessibility issues if people struggle to perceive the small dots. I aimed to address these issues with other design choices (discussed below)."

    "text": "Accessibility\n\nData encoding\nAs I described above, I decided to represent one million people with a small dot. I then coloured these dots based on the people’s characteristics - e.g., whether they have disabilities. Since these small elements could be difficult for people with visual impairments to perceive, I ensured that all of the statistics were also encoded by the shapes formed by the dots:\n\nWhile the dots represented by people with disabilities are mixed into the circle that forms the global population, I extract those dots into a second, smaller circle that represents people with disabilities. The relative areas of those two circles encode the percentage of people with disabilities: the people with disabilities circle is approximately 1/6th the area of the global population circle.\nThe demographic information forms stacked bar charts, with the length of each section encoding the corresponding percentage. This double encoding should help everyone understand the data, as it’s much easier to perceive differences in lengths than differences in dot numbers.\n\n\n\nColour\nI avoided using the most problematic colour combinations for people with colour vision deficiencies, but I didn’t want to rely on that approach, especially since there are many different types of deficiencies. Therefore, to make my visualisation accessible, I also ensured that (1) neighbouring colours were differentiated by lightness as well as hue, and (2) no data encodings relied on colour alone. For example, each bar chart has vertical lines marking the boundaries between groups.\nTo check the impact of my colour choices on accessibility, I used Adobe’s colourblind checker and the Colbis (Color Blindness Simulator).\n\n\nFont, text, and contrast\nAfter researching factors that impact font accessibility, I decided to use Atkinson Hyperlegible, a font designed by the Braille Institute for people with low vision. It’s also freely available under the Open Font License, which was one of my requirements. Atkinson Hyperlegible uses extra space and exaggerated letterforms to make it easier to distinguish similar characters. The designed asymmetries also make it easier to distinguish letters that are mirror images of each other, such as p and q (e.g., compare the q in “inequities” vs. the p in “people” in my visualisation). The font was designed to be suitable for general audiences as well, and the distinct letterforms can improve readability for many people.\nAll of my text is either dark grey or purple that meets the WCAG 2.1 AAA standards for contrast against the white background (checked using Adobe’s accessibility tools). I also checked the contrast of the purple dots against the grey dots in the “global population” circle.\nThe size of all of the text is 10+ pt when the image width is 6.5+ inches, with the most important messages in larger font sizes. The visualisation has a high resolution so that it can be viewed at a larger size if desired.\n\n\nData accessibility\nThe image has the following alt text:\nA visualisation that represents every 1 million people in the world with one dot to show that 1 in 6 people, or 1.3 billion people worldwide, have a significant disability. To show the diversity of people with disabilities, the dots are rearranged into three stacked bar charts that provide sex, age, and country income level demographics.\nOne downside of using R to make a static visualisation is that, to my knowledge, there isn’t a way to allow screen readers to navigate the different chart elements. To make sure the key messages are still accessible, I also provide a text version of the main messages and statistics below the visualisation."
